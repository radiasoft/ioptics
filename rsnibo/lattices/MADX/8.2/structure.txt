Abstract
This document describes the structure of IOTA mad-x lattice files and supporting 
tools for tracking simulations. Users interested in the ready-to-use IOTA 
lattice files should skip to Section II.

I. Directory structure

doc/      documentation
seq/      ready to use mad-x sequence files
include/  machine confuguration and beam line definition files
out/      all mad-x output 
scripts/  support tools
lifetrac/ Lifetrac input and output files
tests/    tests and benchmarking

_______________________________________________________________________________
II. Sequence files, naming conventions

The seq/ directory contains mad-x sequences for a number of configurations:
lattice_1IO.seq           - bare machine with 1 Integrable Optics (IO) section,
                            no nonlinear magnets installed
lattice_2IO.seq           - same as above but 2 IO sections
lattice_OSC.seq           - machine option for Optical Stochastic Cooling
lattice_1IO_nll.seq       - machine with 1 IO section, 
                            full elliptic potential type magnets (thin)
lattice_1IO_nll_thin.seq  - same as above but all machine magnets converted 
                            to thin multipoles
lattice_1IO_oct.seq       - machine with 1 IO section, octupoles (thin)
lattice_1IO_oct_t.seq     - machine with 1 IO section, octupoles (thick)

III. Main mad-x command files

lattice_main.madx :
Main lattice file (thick elements). Switches are "loption" for the type of
lattice, and "sext" for turning chromaticity correction sextupoles on/off.
The file calls magnet strength parameters from include/quads* files,
call element descriptions from include/elements.madx and beamline
definitions from include/lines.madx

Further, the twiss parameters are calculated and plotted (output to out/plot*)
The resulting sequence is saved into seq/lattice*

install_integrab.madx :
mad-x command file with macros for the installation of integrable optics
elements into the sequence.

The nonlinear lens parameters are defined through a number of variables,
and then mad-x macros are called which install the elements into the 
appropriate drift in the lattice. The sequence is then saved into a
file in seq/

The elements can be of 4 types:
- full elliptic potential (NLLENS)
- quadrupole only
- quadrupole + octupole
- octupole only

The octupoles can be either thick or thin.

makethin.madx :
Slices the thick lattice mad-x lattice to convert it into the drift-kick 
configuration for symplectic tracking. Also, a fake beam-beam element is
installed, which is required by Lifetrac code.

The output is written into a sequence in seq/

madx2ltr.madx :
Produces twiss output for subsequent conversion to Lifetrac. This operation
must be done with a specially patched version of mad-x.

IV. Included files

There are three main types of included files.
a) *.dat files describe the quadrupole strengths (for now calibrations 
current/gradient are not included, and thus strength is given in mad-x units),
relation of circuits to physical elements, and strengths of solenoids
and sextupoles
b) elements.madx describes the physical elements
c) lines.madx and OSC.madx describe the beam lines

V. Scripts

madx2ltr.pl and madx2ltr.sh are the scripts for conversion of mad-x output
into Lifetrac input
